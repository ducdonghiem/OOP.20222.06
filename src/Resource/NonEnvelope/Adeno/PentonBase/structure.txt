The penton base is a fibrous protein found in the capsid. It forms a pentameric complex, consisting of five subunits that assemble together. The penton base has a distinct structure and is involved in viral attachment and entry into host cells. Its fibrous nature contributes to the stability and integrity of the viral capsid.
