The fiber protein of adenovirus plays a critical role in the attachment of the virus to host cells, initiating infection. It binds to specific receptors on the cell surface, determining the tissue tropism and host range of the virus. The fiber protein is involved in viral entry into host cells through endocytosis and may also contribute to immune evasion.
