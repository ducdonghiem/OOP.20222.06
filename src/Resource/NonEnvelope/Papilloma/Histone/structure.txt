Histones are a group of proteins that form the core of nucleosomes. They consist of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 proteins, which come together to create an octamer structure. The DNA wraps around these histone proteins, forming a nucleosome. Histones also have flexible N-terminal tails that can be chemically modified. These structural features enable efficient packaging and organization of DNA within the nucleus.
