The genomic DNA of human papillomavirus (HPV) is a circular, covalently closed molecule that exists as episomal DNA within host cells. Unlike some other viruses, HPV DNA does not integrate into the host cell genome. The HPV genomic DNA is organized into different regions that encode viral proteins necessary for viral replication and gene expression.
