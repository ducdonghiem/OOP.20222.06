The E1 and E2 glycoproteins play essential roles in viral attachment, entry, and fusion with host cells. They facilitate the binding of the virus to specific receptors on the surface of host cells, allowing the virus to enter and infect the cells. Additionally, these glycoproteins are involved in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, enabling the release of the viral genome into the host cell cytoplasm. The E1 and E2 proteins are crucial for the infectivity and spread of chikungunya virus.
