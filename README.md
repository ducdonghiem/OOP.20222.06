Basic knowledge:-Basic structure of virus:
+ Every virus has 2 basic elements: acid nucleic and capsid.
+ Based on their structure, viruses are divided into 2 categories: with and without lipid envelop.
•Virus without envelop will dissolve its capsid when reach the target cell
•Virus with envelop usually has anchors, called glycoprotein. The mechanism for infecting in this case is by lock–key: when reaching the host cell with the suitable outer structure, it uses its glycoproteins to attach
then injects its acid nucleic into the cel
