While its specific structure is not as extensively studied as L1, capsid protein L2 is known to interact with L1 and contribute to the stability of the capsid. It aids in viral entry into host cells, assists in the trafficking of the viral genome to the nucleus, and facilitates the disassembly of the viral capsid for the release of the viral DNA.
