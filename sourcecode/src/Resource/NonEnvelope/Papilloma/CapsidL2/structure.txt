Capsid protein L2 is considered a minor capsid protein, meaning it is less abundant than the major capsid protein, L1. It is found within the inner layers of the viral capsid. L2 contains conserved domains that are essential for its functions in viral infection and trafficking. These domains include the N-terminal domain, the central domain, and the C-terminal domain.
