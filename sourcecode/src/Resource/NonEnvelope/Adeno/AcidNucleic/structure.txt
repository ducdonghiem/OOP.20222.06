The structure of dsDNA is a double helix, with two complementary strands twisted around each other. The strands are made up of nucleotides, including a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases. The base pairs between the strands (A with T, and C with G) provide stability to the DNA structure. The adenovirus dsDNA contains genes that encode viral proteins and regulatory regions.
