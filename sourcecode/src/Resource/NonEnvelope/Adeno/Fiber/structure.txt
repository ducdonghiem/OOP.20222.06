The fiber structure includes: fiber shaft and fiber knob. The shaft is the main structural component of the fiber protein. It is composed of a long, flexible rod-like structure that extends outward from the viral capsid. At the distal end of the shaft, there is a globular structure known as the knob. It contains receptor-binding sites or motifs that enable the virus to recognize and attach to specific cellular receptors.
