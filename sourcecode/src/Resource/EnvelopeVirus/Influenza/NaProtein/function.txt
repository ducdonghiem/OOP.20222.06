Neuraminidase (Na) is a crucial glycoprotein found on the surface of the influenza virus. Its main function is to facilitate the release of viral particles from infected cells. By cleaving sialic acid residues on the cell surface, Na breaks the bonds between the viruses and the host cell, allowing the newly formed viruses to spread and infect other cells in the respiratory tract. This enzymatic activity of Na is targeted by antiviral medications, which can effectively inhibit viral replication and reduce the severity and duration of influenza symptoms.
