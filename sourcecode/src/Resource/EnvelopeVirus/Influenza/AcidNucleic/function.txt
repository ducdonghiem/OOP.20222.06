Together, PB1, PB2, and PA form a functional RNA polymerase complex. This complex is essential for viral replication and transcription within host cells. The complex catalyzes the synthesis of new viral RNA, ensuring the replication and production of viral proteins necessary for the assembly of new influenza virus particles.
