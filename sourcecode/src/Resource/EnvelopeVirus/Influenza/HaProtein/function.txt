Hemagglutinin, commonly referred to as Ha, is one of the most important glycoproteins present on the surface of the influenza virus. This crucial protein plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle, particularly during the early stages of infection. Hemagglutinin's primary function is to facilitate viral attachment and entry into host cells.
