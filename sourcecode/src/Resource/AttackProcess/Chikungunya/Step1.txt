Entry: Chikungunya virus reaches the target cell by attaching to specific receptors on the cell surface. This attachment is mediated by viral envelope proteins, such as E2 glycoprotein, binding to cellular receptors. The interaction between the virus and receptors allows for the virus to gain access to the host cell.
