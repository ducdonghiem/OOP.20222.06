Entry: Following attachment, influenza virus enters the host cell. The virus is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, in which the host cell engulfs the virus within a membrane-bound vesicle called an endosome. Inside the endosome, a process triggered by the low pH environment causes the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane. This fusion releases the viral genetic material (RNA) into the host cell cytoplasm.
