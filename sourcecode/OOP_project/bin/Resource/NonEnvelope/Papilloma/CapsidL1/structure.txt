The capsid protein L1 forms a stable pentameric assembly, consisting of five subunits, which contributes to the overall structure and integrity of the capsid. The L1 protein contains distinct structural domains, such as the N-terminal arm, beta-jelly roll domain, and C-terminal arm, which play important roles in the formation and stability of the capsid. The pentameric arrangement of L1 proteins allows for the assembly of the characteristic icosahedral capsid structure observed in HPV. Additionally, the L1 protein contains epitopes that can be recognized by the immune system, making it an important target for immune responses during HPV infection.
