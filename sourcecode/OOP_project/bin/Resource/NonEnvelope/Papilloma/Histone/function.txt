Histones have important functions in DNA packaging, chromatin structure, gene expression regulation, and maintaining genomic integrity. They help compact DNA, organize it into chromatin, and influence the accessibility of genes. Histone modifications can control gene expression patterns without changing the DNA sequence. Additionally, histones are involved in DNA repair and replication processes.
