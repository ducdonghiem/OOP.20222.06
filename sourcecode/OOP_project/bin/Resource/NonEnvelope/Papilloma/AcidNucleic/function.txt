The genomic DNA of the virus serves as the genetic blueprint for viral replication, gene expression, and the production of viral proteins. It carries the necessary instructions for viral replication, controls gene expression, and enables the synthesis of viral proteins essential for various viral processes. Additionally, it plays a role in viral transmission and infection, as well as genetic variation within the viral population.
