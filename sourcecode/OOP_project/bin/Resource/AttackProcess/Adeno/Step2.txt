Entry and Escape: The virus enters the cell by being engulfed into an endosome. The endosome can form when the virus is taken up by the cell through a process called endocytosis. If the virus enters through the endosome, it finds a way to break out of it and release its genetic material into the cell. The fiber helps the virus in this process.
