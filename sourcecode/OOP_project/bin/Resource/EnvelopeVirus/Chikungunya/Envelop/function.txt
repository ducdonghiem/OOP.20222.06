The envelope serves as a protective barrier for the virus, enclosing the viral components, including the viral genome, capsid, and envelope glycoproteins. It allows the virus to interact with and enter host cells during the infection process. The lipid bilayer of the membrane provides structural integrity to the virus and facilitates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, enabling viral entry. The membrane is essential for the infectivity and survival of chikungunya virus.
